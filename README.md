# Trailerflix

Trailerflix is a more advanced version of the project I designed and developed in second year, called ['The Movie Db'](https://github.com/MarkSweeney96/the_movie_db). I designed and developed this project in my final year of college as part of my Advanced JavaScript module.

Instead of using my own database, I used The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Responses from this API populate all search queries. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Axios requests for the API. The design was implemented using the Bootstrap CSS framework.

## Installation

You will need to register for an API key to make this project work in your version of the code. You can request an API key by registering for an account at [https://www.themoviedb.org/signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup). Once you have an account, go to Settings > API > Request an API Key. More info can be found by [clicking here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Add your API key to line 27 and 70 in the file __js/main.js__ in place of '__YOUR_API_KEY__'.
